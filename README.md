With the global demand for sustainable agriculture and food
security, the accurate and timely diagnosis of plant diseases has
become paramount. Traditional methods of disease detection
are often time-consuming and labor-intensive, necessitating the
need for advanced technological solutions. In recent years,
deep learning techniques, particularly Convolutional Neural
Networks (CNNs), have demonstrated remarkable success in
various image classification tasks, including medical diagnosis
and object recognition.
The critical challenge of automated
plant disease classification using a CNN-based approach. Our
study leverages a rich dataset obtained from the PlantVillage
repository, encompassing diverse plant species and diseases.
The proposed model incorporates essential components such
as data augmentation, batch normalization, and dropout layers,
optimizing its ability to generalize patterns from images of
varying conditions.
The significance of our work lies not only in achieving
high classification accuracy but also in enhancing model inter-
pretability. To address the interpretability concern associated
with deep neural networks, we integrate Local Interpretable
Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME), offering insights into
the decision-making process of the CNN. This interpretability
aspect is crucial for building trust in the modelâ€™s predictions,
particularly in applications such as precision agriculture, where
transparent decision-making is essential.
Moreover, we explore the practical deployment of the model
through a user-friendly interface, allowing real-time predic-
tions from user-provided images. This feature opens avenues
for farmers and agricultural practitioners to employ the system
for on-field disease detection, contributing to early intervention
and improved crop management.
